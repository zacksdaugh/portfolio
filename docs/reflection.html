            <i>There are quite a few challenges that lie in wait for new learners trying to create a
                website. However, with enough persistence anyone can learn how. First and foremost,
                learning the syntax for web development is like learning a new language. Thankfully
                I was able to pick it up rather quickly and keep moving forward. While learning the
                syntax may seem minute, it really is a massive roadblock for those that have no
                background in web development. Therefore, it is IMPERATIVE that students learn the
                syntax first and fast. Another challenge for new learners is the abundance of
                options. It can feel like a lot to take in at once. The easiest way to navigate this
                challenge is to "only bite off what you can chew". Each platform (GitHub and
                Wordpress) have advantages and disadvantages to both. It feels eerily similar to the
                Android vs. Apple debate. GitHub has so many options when using CSS. You can write
                your own code exactly how you want it to be presented. I prefer total control like
                that. Unlike GitHub, in Wordpress you are restricted to what the platform provides
                to you. It is a template structure and has a limited interface that can be confusing
                to beginners. As restrictive as it may be, it is user friendly (once you learn to
                navigate the site). GitHub is not without its own challenges. GitHub can be hard to
                learn. It requires the correct syntax and is incredibly easy to "screw up". The
                skills required to develop a site on these platforms vary in difficulty. GitHub is
                definitely more challenging to learn. One has to learn the mark-up language, HTML,
                CSS, and the "Terminal". It requires vast amounts of patience, but the outcome can
                turn out to be something spectacular and original. The only real skills needed to
                create a site on Wordpress are creativity and patience. As long as you have a vision
                and it fits within the parameters of the site, then Wordpress is a quick and easy
                tool for basic web developers. In conclusion, there are a few skills I would like to
                develop during my time at Penn State Behrend. I would like to learn more about CSS
                and HTML techniques. I enjoyed the ability to change every little aspect of a site
                with just a little bit of code. I feel like I have just scratched the surface, and
                all I want to do is learn more.</i>
