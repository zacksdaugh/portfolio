        <p style="text-align: center; color: white; font-size: 30px"> Right out of high school I served six years in
            the US Army Transportation Corps supplying 777’s to field artillery gun lines. I
            deployed all over southern Europe, and I was able to gain tremendous world perspective
            at a young age. After my stint in Army, I helped manage, and eventually owned a portion
            of, Watkins Boxing & Muay Thai in Indiana, PA. I managed all the digital content, the
            financials, and helped train professional & amateur fighters. Now I attend Penn State as
            an adult learner, and I couldn’t be happier. </p>
