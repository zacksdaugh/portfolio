            <i>Right out of high school I served six years in the US Army Transportation Corps
                supplying field artillery gun lines. I deployed all over southern Europe, and I was
                able to gain tremendous world perspective at a young age. After my stint in Army, I
                helped manage, and eventually owned a portion of, Watkins Boxing & Muay Thai in
                Indiana, PA. I managed all the digital content, the financials, and helped train
                professional & amateur fighters. Now I attend Penn State as an adult learner in the
                DIGIT department, and I couldnâ€™t be happier!</i>

        <p style="font-size: 25px; color: white"> "Dear Data" is a year-long, analog data drawing
            project by Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec that we (DIGIT 100 with Dr. Beshero-Bondar)
            studied in the 2024 Fall semester at Penn State Behrend. After studying the project we
            then developed our own human data visualizations that yielded tremendous variety. The
            purpose of this project was to educate ourselves on the different ways data can be
            presented and interpreted by different people. </p>

        <p style="font-size: 25px; color: white"> In the 2024 Fall semester at Penn State Behrend during my DIGIT 100 class I
            learned how to work with zipped folders, gain hands-on experience with HTML code and
            folder "ecosystems". Another subject I learned about was version control systems and how
            they work (github). I learned how to add content, nav bars, css styling code, as well as
            other various web developement skills. </p>
